            <h2>  What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <br>
                versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
            <p>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content <br>
                of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has <br>
                a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, <br>
                content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages <br>
                and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <br>
                'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have <br>
                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). <br>
